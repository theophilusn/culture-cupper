  Ryan’s start at zu was a humble one — designing for Saskatoon small businesses while exploring the uncharted Internet in ‘95. A true community builder, Ryan played founding roles in BarCamp, Moso Conference, TEDx, and SaskInteractive, all while serving on boards for SREDA, ITSA,  STEP, and SaskTech — tirelessly promoting our industry.
